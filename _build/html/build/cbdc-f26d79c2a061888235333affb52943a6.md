According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) [@bis2017],
money is categorized based on four overlapping properties:

-   **Issuer:** central bank (e.g. reserve accounts) vs. private (e.g.
    deposit accounts, crypto).

-   **Form:** electronic (e.g. bank deposits, crypto) vs. physical (e.g.
    cash).

-   **Accessibility:** Universal (e.g. cash) vs. restricted/wholesale
    (e.g. reserve accounts)

-   **Technology:** Peer-to-peer/Token-based (e.g. cash, crypto) vs.
    account-based (e.g. bank deposits)

A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a unique form of money that is
electronic, central bank issued and widely available to the general
public (except wholesale CBCD) that can be token or account based.

# Global Landscape

The global adoption of CBDCs is accelerating. As of December 2025
[@atlantic_2025],

-   3 countries have fully launched a digital currency: the Bahamas,
    Jamaica, and Nigeria.

-   137 countries & currency unions, representing 98% of global GDP, are
    exploring a CBDC with 72 in advanced phases of exploration.

-   49 CBDC pilot projects are currently running around the world, the
    digital euro project of the EU being one of them.

Emerging markets are driving global retail CBDC growth:

-   Digital yuan (e-CNY) is the largest CBDC pilot in the world with a
    total transaction volume of 7 trillion e-CNY (\$986 billion) in
    2024.

-   India's e-rupee with 10.16 billion rupee (\$122 million) in 2025 is
    the second-largest CBDC pilot.

# Motivations for CBDC Issuance

#### Maintaining public access to central-bank backed money

-   Currently, cash is the only form of money that is *risk-free* and
    *provides instant settlement* that is accessible to public.

-   However, the use of cash is in decline: ECB [@clipal2025cash]
    reports that the share of cash in payments decreased across all age
    groups between 2019 and 2024.

-   Meanwhile, the significance of digital economy and digital payments
    is steadily rising.

    -   The digital economy makes up more than 15% of the global GDP
        [@WEF_2022]

    -   The total value of cashless payments grew by 15% globally in
        2021 [@BIS_2023]

#### Preservation of monetary sovereignity.

-   Wide adoption of stablecoins or private money runs the risk of fully
    privatized and/or dollarized payment systems, endangering monetary
    sovereignity, in particular in developing/unstable economies.

-   Currency internationalization: The world is expected to evolve
    towards a multipolar currency system. The large economies in the
    world aim to establish or strengthen the role of their currency in
    international finance through CBDCs [@dailami2009new].

#### Reducing reliance on foreign, uncompetitive payment providers

-   Digital payments market is highly concentrated and dominated by US
    companies, resulting in high interchange fees on merchants and no
    incentives for innovation.

-   Moreover, the opacity in the collection and usage of user data raise
    privacy and digital sovereignty concerns.

#### Other functionalities for emerging markets

[@atlantic_2025]

-   financial inclusion : improve access to digital payments for the
    unbanked,

-   regulatory oversight: reduce the use of cash and the share of
    informal economy

# Potential hazards & key design challenges of CBDC

-   **Achieving wide adoption without crowding out private innovation**

    -   Network effects make corner solutions (total failure or market
        domination) more likely outcomes for a digital currency. A
        delicate balance will have to be preserved to ensure wide
        availability and acceptability (to maintain uniformity of
        currency & interoperability) without crowding out private actors
        (not to hamper innovation & efficiency)

-   **Preventing financial disintermediation**

    -   Depositors may prefer CBDC accounts over deposit accounts,
        especially in times of economic uncertainty, thereby increasing
        banks' funding cost and leading to financial disintermediation

    -   The convenience of converting between digital currencies
        (instead of withdrawing cash) might increase the risk of bank
        runs.

-   **Privacy violation & use for illicit activities**

    -   While anonymity can protect user privacy, it also makes it more
        difficult to exercise AML/CFT practices

    -   Lack of privacy guarantees, on the other hand, can create
        challenges in managing the public sentiment regarding the threat
        of a 'surveillance state', particularly in countries with less
        trust in public institutions.

# CBDC Design Features

-   Interest & holding caps

    -   If cash eventually disappears, an interest bearing CBDC can
        overcome the zero-lower bound problem in monetary policy
        transmission.

    -   A cap on individual holdings can mitigate the bank
        disintermediation risk but it can reduce payment functionality

    -   A tiered-remuneration is another alternative for mitigating bank
        disintermediation without creating payment frictions. However it
        increases complexity which can reduce adoption and raises
        calibration challenges.

-   Access technology (account or token based)

    -   Token-based access improves flexibility and innovation but
        requires safeguards against key loss and may hinder adoption by
        less sophisticated users.

-   Role of intermediaries

    -   The BIS [@auer2020technology] identifies three primary
        architectural models for retail CBDCs: Direct, Indirect, and
        Hybrid. These models define the division of labor and legal
        claims between the central bank and private-sector
        intermediaries.

-   Functionality

    -   A payment alternative with add-on functionalities can drive
        initial adoption but it implies a public cost, limit the
        capacity for scaling and crowd out innovation by the private
        sector

A recent report by BIS [@BIS_CGIDE_2024_CBDC_Architecture] provides
expert opinion on the optimal design of CBDC architecture:

-   The report proposes the adoption of a hybrid architecture where the
    central bank provides the core public infrastructure (issuance,
    settlement, and governance), while the private sector
    (intermediaries) delivers user-facing services (wallet provision,
    KYC/AML and customer support). This model ensures that CBDC is a
    direct claim on the central bank while simultaneously leveraging
    private-sector know-how and encouraging diversity and competition.

-   The architecture implies that the central bank maintains a full
    transaction ledger, but without identity data while identity and KYC
    information remain with intermediaries, satisfying simultaneously
    privacy and financial integrity requirements.

-   While there is no mention of an interest-bearing design, the report
    recommends a two-tiered wallet design with and without (or minimal)
    KYC requirements, each implying different holding and transaction
    caps. This design choice aims not only at preserving financial
    stability but also at providing a cash-like alternative with
    privacy-by-design without compromising financial integrity.

-   Lastly, while holding a tech-neutral stance, the report emphasizes
    the economic potential of the add-on functionalities enabled by a
    permissioned DLT ledger such as programmability, atomic settlements,
    delivery-versus-payments, offline payments and interoperability with
    tokenised assets.

# Alternatives to CBCD

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Unlike
cryptocurrencies, stablecoins promise price stability, making them a
much more viable option to fulfill the key functions of money, i.e. to
serve as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Yet,
until recently, stablecoins were considered unfit for this role due to

-   lack of regulation, transparency & user protection,

-   a track record of instability contradicting its core premise

However, a recent regulatory move by the US is set to change this
perception. The recent Genius Act (2025) [@genius_act_2025] aims to
strengthen regulation, stability, transparency and user protection,
mandating

-   a license to operate as a payment stablecoin,

-   monthly, audited disclosures of reserve holdings,

-   1:1 backing by high-quality liquid assets,

-   prohibition from paying interest, and

-   senior priority claims to customers in case of bankruptcy

Nevertheless, even when appropriately regulated, wide adoption of
stablecoins brings along certain risks and policy challenges
[@stablecoin_BIS_2025]:

-   Bank disintermediation: If depositors shift largely into
    stablecoins, banks lose a key source of cheap, stable funding

-   Financial stability risk:

    -   Loss of deposit funding renders banks generally more sensitive
        to volatility.

    -   Stablecoin market remains highly concentrated (90% of market
        capitalisation accounted for by USDT and USDC) and stablecoins
        hold large reserves in treasury bills. Therefore, a potential
        run from any of these major stablecoins runs the risk of
        triggering a fire sale of T-bills, spreading risk across the
        entire financial system.

-   Run risk: A potential stablecoin run can be faster and more severe
    than bank runs given that stablecoins

    -   cannot access central bank liquidity or deposit insurance

    -   tend to have a user base that is more active than small deposit
        holders

    -   are susceptible to blockchain & smart contract dynamics.

-   Digital dollarization: Cross border use of stablecoins have been
    rising - particularly in response to volatility in inflation and
    exchange rates - which runs the risk of reducing the effectiveness
    of domestic policy rate.

## Private money

-   Conceptually, private money diverges from stablecoins in that its
    supply can be controlled by a private issuer that can act like a
    central bank, without any requirements for backing.

-   There are currently no widely adopted examples of private money.
    However, BigTech is the most plausible candidate for such
    undertaking as it requires wide-adoption and trust in the private
    issuer. The most prominent attempt so far was the Libra project by
    Meta in 2019 which was shut down in 2022 due to regulatory and
    political pressures.

-   Private money --- along with the usual risks of loss of monetary
    sovereignty and/or digital dollarization --- runs the risk of
    creating a fragmented digital economy where each ecosystem operates
    with its own currency, much like different countries. This can
    result in efficiency loss and opportunities for rent extraction by
    creating currency risk and switching costs across major digital
    platforms.
