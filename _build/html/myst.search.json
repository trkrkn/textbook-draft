Under ancient or medieval conditions, feeding such a force was an enormous problem—unless they were on the march, one would need to employ almost as many men and animals just to locate, acquire, and transport the necessary provisions.\n\nOn the other hand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you, one would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get their hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want.\n\nMarkets are brought into existence as a side effect.\"\n\nGraeber (2011)\n\n","type":"content","url":"/money#issuance-of-money-and-debt","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Money","lvl2":"4.

Currently\nthere are no super apps at the scale of WeChat or AliPay in western\ncountries. Unlike most Asian countries, western economies are\ncharacterized by more fragmented markets, stronger privacy norms,\nstricter competition and data regulation as well as stronger legacy\nalternatives for financial services, making them less habitable\nenvironments for super apps.\n\nThat being said, the recent initiatives from BigTech companies signal\nambition and competition towards building the first wester super app:\n\nMeta Pay: Meta’s unified digital wallet embedded across\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, designed to handle\npeer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, creator monetization, and\neventually broader commerce and financial services.

Cloud computing is one such\nexample: Cloud computing provides remote and on-demand access to\ncomputing power, data storage and software instead of relying on\nin-house IT infrastructure. Over the past decade, financial institutions\nhave aggressively migrated core systems and data infrastructure to the\ncloud, seeking to improve their speed, agility, and resilience. Major\nbanks like HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered, and Barclays are\nadopting cloud-first strategies.
