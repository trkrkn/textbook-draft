# Special: Platformisation of Finance

Over the past two decades, digital innovation has profoundly reshaped
the structure of financial markets. Finance is transitioning from a
system dominated by vertically and horizontally integrated banks into a
modular, platform-based ecosystem in which services are increasingly
unbundled, re-bundled, and embedded into broader digital
infrastructures.

Finance in the age of platforms is shaped by a tension between
modularity and concentration. While digital technologies lower entry
barriers and enable specialization, network effects, synergies,
information spillovers and infrastructure costs continuously drive
re-bundling and market power.

## Traditional banking before digital innovation

Before the digital revolution, banking was characterized by large,
integrated institutions. High transaction costs and strong economies of
scale and scope favored consolidation and concentration. Banks were
characterized by

-   **Vertical Integration**: Keeping activities in-house helped
    reducing principal--agent problems, contractual incompleteness,
    uncertainty and information governance issues.

-   **Horizontal Integration**: Banks expanded horizontally across
    financial services to exploit economies of scope, cross-selling
    opportunities, informational spillovers between deposits, payments,
    credit, and investment services.

-   **Market concentration:** High fixed infrastructure and compliance
    costs, informational barriers to entry, network effects and scale
    economies resulted in an infertile ground for competition.

## Digital innovation and the advent of FinTech

Digital innovation weakened the natural monopoly logic of banking,
enabling entry, specialization, and modularity by sharply reducing core
transaction costs such as [@goldfarb2019digital]:

-   **Search and transportation costs**: mobile internet access.

-   **Tracking costs**: big data, machine learning, and AI.

-   **Verification and compliance costs**: RegTech, digital identity,
    e-KYC.

-   **Infrastructure costs**: cloud computing.

-   **Coordination and enforcement costs**: distributed ledger
    technology (DLT) and smart contracts.

This resulted in an unbundling of customer facing financial services,
and the back-end services powering them, across specialized actors
coordinated through APIs.

-   E.g.: A consumer can now deposit her money at a digital bank
    (e.g. N26), initiate payments via standalone apps (e.g. Payconiq),
    acces credit from a BNPL business (e.g. Klarna) and use an investing
    platform to manage her portfolio (e.g. Robinhood).

-   E.g. The value chain a payment service is composed of is
    disintegrated into components such as client-facing wallets (e.g.
    Revolut, PayPal, Apple Pay), payment initiation service providers
    (PISPs) (e.g. Tink, Plaid, TrueLayer), processors and gateways
    (Stripe, Adyen, Worldpay), payment rails (SEPA, Visa, Mastercard,
    SWIFT), ledger and custody services (by licensed banks) and AML,
    KYC, fraud detection services by RegTech firms.

## Re-bundling and platformization of finance

### FinTechs.

Despite the tech-fueled disintegration, re-bundling forces such as

-   large fixed-cost amortization,

-   data synergies across services,

-   user-side and cross-side network effects.

remain strong [@worldbank2022finance]. Accordingly, major FinTech firms
increasingly expand both scale and scope:

-   Most digital banks and wallets now bundle crypto, insurance,
    investments, rewards, and bill management.

-   Stripe evolved from payment processing into lending, fraud
    prevention, tax handling.

-   Payconiq merged, integrated, and was acquired into a pan-European
    payment initiative (EPI).

**Banks.** Banks' business models are gradually transitioning into

-   **Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: providing infrastructure and
    licensing for non-bank digital ecosystems to enable the integration
    of financial services

-   **Banking-as-a-Platform (BaaP)**: serving as the intermediary
    between customers and third-party services

These models allow banks to meet the consumer demand for innovative and
affordable digital services all the while leveraging their existing
(legal and technical) infrastructure and customer relationships.

**Public sector.** Digital public infrastructures emerging across the
globe aim to facilitate innovation and competition while strengthening
digital sovereignty and preserving the efficiency advantages of network
and scale effects.

-   **Wero:** Introduced by the European Payments Initiative (EPI), Wero
    is a pan-European digital wallet designed as a modular platform
    integrating A2A payments, BNPL, digital ID, and loyalty services.

-   **Unified Payments Interface:** The Indian instant payment system
    developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)
    offers inter-bank peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M)
    transactions as well as extensive add-on services such as autopay
    for recurring bills, account aggregation, overdraft facilities and
    international remittances.

-   **Pix:** An instant payment system created by the Central Bank of
    Brazil, Pix enables 24/7, real-time P2P and P2M money transfers as
    well as services like scheduled payments, BNPL, cash winthdrawal and
    cashback.

## Mobile Money.

Mobile money, a financial solution that emerged and scaled in
Sub-Saharan Africa, enables users to store and transfer value via mobile
phones without bank accounts. The key drivers behind mobile money's
success are

-   **network effects**: a large existing base of telecom users,

-   **infrastructure advantage**: scalable transaction infrastructure,
    extensive agent networks,

-   **user trust**: acquaintance with topping up phones and trust with
    the operator with digital value.

-   **regulatory flexibility**: more agility and speed compared to
    heavily regulated banks

-   **financial underreach**: a large unbanked or underserved population
    by traditional financial institutions.

The evolution of mobile money is a testimony to the power of network and
data effects: It took 18 years for the mobile money industry to reach
one billion accounts, but only five years to double that number
[@gsma2025]. In line with the re-bundling trend, several mobile money
providers (e.g. Paytm (India), Grab (Singapore), M-Pesa (SSA)) are
increasingly expanding their range of service into other financial
products in partnership with banks and FinTechs (GSMA).

## Super apps

Super apps bundle financial and non-financial services - such as
deliveries, ticket booking, shopping, ridehailing - forming closed
ecosystems where data and activity remain within the platform. Thus,
superapp users exchange convenience for surveillance.

The super app model first emerged and scaled in Asia (with WeChat and
AliPay), later spreading to parts of Africa and Latin America. Currently
there are no super apps at the scale of WeChat or AliPay in western
countries. Unlike most Asian countries, western economies are
characterized by more fragmented markets, stronger privacy norms,
stricter competition and data regulation as well as stronger legacy
alternatives for financial services, making them less habitable
environments for super apps.

That being said, the recent initiatives from BigTech companies signal
ambition and competition towards building the first wester super app:

-   **Meta Pay:** Meta's unified digital wallet embedded across
    Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, designed to handle
    peer-to-peer payments, in-app purchases, creator monetization, and
    eventually broader commerce and financial services. While not enough
    to constitute a super app by itself, Meta Pay is regarded as a
    payment spine that could support deeper re-bundling if regulatory
    conditions allow.

-   **X Money:** X's emerging payments and financial layer, built around
    a digital wallet and peer-to-peer transfers. X Money currently sits
    atop existing financial rails and faces tight regulatory
    constraints. Still, by embedding payments directly into social
    interaction and identity, X Money represents a step closer towards
    the super app model, an ambition frequently voiced by the company
    CEO himself, Elon Musk [@Guardian_2023]

## Big Tech's Entry into Finance

Several factors motivate the entry and success of Big Tech in financial
services:

-   **Data--Network--Activity Feedback Loop**: Big Tech generates large
    troves of data thanks to network externalities. This data enhances
    service quality and attracts even more users and more data which
    allows Big Tech to offer a wider range of activities, yielding even
    more data [@doerr2023big].

-   **Regulatory leeway**: lighter or fragmented oversight allows
    regulatory arbitrage [@buchak2018fintech].

-   **Unmet credit needs**: especially in emerging markets; high banking
    margins (low competition) create room for entry.

### Big Tech & Payments:

Large user networks, rich behavioral data and economies of scope across
financial and non-financial services provide a competitive advantage to
Big Tech in payment markets, sharply lowering adoption and coordination
costs. The dominance of Big Tech in payments in China demonstrates how
these factors can result in a winner-takes-all dynamics in the absence
of strong regulatory safeguards.

### Big Tech & Lending:

Big Tech has certain advantages in offering credit such as:

-   superior monitoring and enforcement & reduced reliance on collateral

-   alternative data-based credit scoring,

-   threat of platform exclusion.

Evidence shows that Big Tech lending can improve credit access for
constrained borrowers:

-   Mercado Libre's proprietary credit score can correctly lend to 30%
    of borrowers that credit bureaus label as high risk
    [@frost2019bigtech]

-   In China, SMEs using QR-code payments have up to 87 % probability of
    receiving Big Tech credit after 3 years [@beck2022big]

-   Platform lending may improve credit access for the most constrained
    borrowers even when it is technologically inferior to bank lending
    [@bouvard2022lending]

## A new source of systemic risk: Cloud Computing

While technological innovation lowers entry barriers and infrastructure
costs by enabling the outsourcing of services to specialized providers,
it also introduces new concentration risks. Cloud computing is one such
example: Cloud computing provides remote and on-demand access to
computing power, data storage and software instead of relying on
in-house IT infrastructure. Over the past decade, financial institutions
have aggressively migrated core systems and data infrastructure to the
cloud, seeking to improve their speed, agility, and resilience. Major
banks like HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered, and Barclays are
adopting cloud-first strategies. Benefits of cloud computing include

-   overcoming economies of scope by

    -   providing access to cutting-edge technology and analytics that
        were previously affordable only to large incumbents

    -   allowing businesses to scale resources flexibly with demand and
        avoid high fixed infrastructure costs

    -   providing built-in compliance frameworks that reduce the
        regulatory burden on small businesses

-   leveraging network & ecosystem benefits

    -   the provider's ecosystem (e.g. marketplaces, data exchanges,
        sandboxes) lower coordination and integration costs, connecting
        entrants to potential partners and customers.

That being said, cloud markets exhibit strong concentration, implying a
significant systemic in case of failure of one of the key providers:

-   Amazon Warehouse Services (AWS) hold 30% of the global cloud market
    share by itself, powering over 90% of Fortune 100 firms.

-   AWS is followed closely by Azure (20%) and Google Cloud (10%)

-   Critical financial and regulatory infrastructures also rely on these
    major cloud services for their operations

Concentration in the cloud-market is driven by the usual factors such as

-   **Ecosystem Network effects:** More users attract more third-party
    tools, integrations, compatible software, skilled developers,
    attracting even more users.

-   **Data and Learning Effects:** More clients generate more
    operational data, helping providers optimize services and attract
    more clients.

-   **Multi-Service Bundling:** Complementary services (analytics,
    cybersecurity, ML tools) raise value for clients

-   **Economies of Scale:** Service costs decrease as the provider
    grows.

-   **Switching costs/lock-in:** Human capital & complementary capital
    that are not perfectly transferable

On October 20 2025, AWS reported significant service disruption lasting
approximately 15 hours. Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, Lloyds Bank, and
Bank of Scotland, among many others, experienced major service
disruptions. The 2025 AWS outage heightened awareness among policymakers
regarding

-   single-point-of-failure risk,

-   digital and financial sovereignty concerns,

-   the emergence of "too-connected-to-fail" cloud providers.

fuelled by the advent of cloud-computing. Accordingly, regulatory forces
are driving the industry towards more resilient, multi-cloud solutions
(e.g., DORA in the EU, SS2/21 in the UK).).
