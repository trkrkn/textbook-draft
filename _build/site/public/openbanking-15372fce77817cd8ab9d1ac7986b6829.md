# Open Banking and Open Finance

Open banking/finance is a policy framework that shifts the control of
data from financial institutions to the customers themselves by enabling
customers to share their financial data with third-party entities
through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [^1]. These entities
in turn utilize this data to provide specialized financial products -
such as loan provision, payment initiation, SME management, accountancy
& tax automation, product comparison or personal finance - to the
end-user.

While open banking is limited to payment accounts held at banks or
equivalent institutions, open finance extends open banking principles to
a broader set of financial institutions and products such as credit,
savings, investment, pensions and insurance.

## Global Landscape of Open Banking and Open Finance

According to the recent CCAF (2024) report [@CCAF_2024]

-   Open Banking adoption is more globally more widespread in comparison
    to Open Finance

    -   60 jurisdictions have passed Open Banking legislation,
        regulation, or official guidance

    -   Early adopters are primarily advanced economies, including the
        UK, the European Union, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and
        Canada.

    -   Several emerging markets have also passed Open Banking
        frameworks, notably Brazil, India, Nigeria, Chile, Turkey, the
        UAE, and Bahrain.

-   While currently less widespread, the adoption of Open Finance is
    accelerating.

    -   Only 16 jurisdictions have passed Open Finance legislation or
        regulation including Brazil, Australia, the Republic of Korea,
        Turkey, the UAE, Nigeria, Jordan, Bahrain, and India.

    -   Approximately 62% of these jurisdictions are emerging markets
        and developing economies (EMDEs).

    -   Major advanced economies lag in Open Finance adoption: the EU
        Open Finance framework (FiDA) is still in development, the UK
        Open Finance regime is in planning while the US is transitioning
        from a market-driven to a regulatory approach.

-   Jurisdictions with the most developed market adoption include

    -   **Brazil**: the most comprehensive Open Finance implementation
        globally, with broad data scope (banking, payments, credit,
        insurance, investments), mandatory participation, and strong API
        standardisation.

    -   **Australia**: mature Open Banking combined with expanding Open
        Finance through the Consumer Data Right.

    -   **Republic of Korea**: rapid implementation supported by strong
        FinTech usage and pre-existing digital payments infrastructure.

    -   **European Union**: strong Open Banking adoption under PSD2,
        though API fragmentation remains a constraint.

    -   **United Kingdom**: strong FinTech adoption, particularly in
        payments and consumer and SME lending.

-   Regulation-led frameworks are empirically associated with faster
    rollout, broader data coverage, and deeper ecosystem development
    than market-led frameworks.

    -   Countries in Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa
        often prefer a regulation-led approach which typically features
        mandatory data sharing and stronger interoperability
        requirements.

    -   Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia-Pacific often prefer a
        market-driven approach which rely primarily on bilateral
        agreements or industry schemes and exhibit slower scaling and
        narrower data coverage.

    -   Latin America and the Caribbeans show no uniform approach (e.g.
        Brazil and Chile are regulation-led, while Mexico and Argentina
        are market-driven)

    -   Some market-driven regimes tend to evolve toward regulatory
        frameworks over time, as seen in the US, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
        and Thailand.

## Motivations for Open Banking

Policymakers promote open banking to address several structural issues
in traditional finance:

-   **Efficiency**: Financial data is *nonrival*, meaning its use by one
    party does not diminish its value for others.

-   **Competition**: The policy breaks the data monopoly held by a few
    large incumbent institutions.

-   **Innovation**: Incumbents have little incentive to innovate; open
    access encourages FinTech entry.

-   **Financial Inclusion**: Utilizing alternative data can alleviate
    information frictions, helping underserved borrowers.

-   **Customer Control**: The policy provides users with a consolidated
    view of their finances and sovereignty over their financial data.

## Early empirical findings

Early findings suggests that open banking

-   lowers entry barriers for FinTechs.

    -   More than 400 FinTech firms were created in the EU following the
        introduction of PSD2 [@OECD2023].

    -   Nearly 300 firms currently provide open-banking services in the
        UK [@OECD2023]

    -   Babina et al. (2022) [@babina2025customer] show that post Open
        Banking, the number and volume of FinTech VC deals in a country
        increases significantly

    -   Alonso-Robisco et al. (2025) [@alonso2025effects] show that,
        following PSD2 in Spain, specialized \"paytech\" firms saw
        increased revenue growth, enhanced productivity, and reduced
        reliance on long-term bank debt.

-   improves credit access, particularly for small businesses

    -   Ghosh et al.(2022) [@ghosh2021fintech]shows that a greater use
        of cashless payments predicts higher rates of loan approval,
        lower interest rates, less default for unsecured small business
        loans.

    -   Yu (2024) [@yu2024data] shows that Open Banking enables new
        forms of collateral (floating lien) such as accounts receivable
        or inventory.

## Long-term GE effect & winners and losers

-   A likely shift from vertically-integrated banks to banks as
    platforms would simultaneously imply a more competitive market for
    financial services and loss of spillovers & synergies among these
    services. The aggregate impact of such a transition on customer
    welfare is not straightforward to predict.

-   The significant IT and compliance costs associated with Open
    Bank/Finance puts smaller banks at a competitive disadvantage.

-   Improved screening/price discrimination capacity might leave some
    borrowers worse-off (see Babina et. al. (2022)
    [@babina2025customer], Parlour et al. (2022) [@parlour2022fintech],
    He et. al. (2023) [@he2023open])

-   Banks' data generating services (e.g. transaction accounts) may
    become more expensive as they become implicitly more valuable as the
    gateway to new products and services (Akoguz et al. (2025)
    [@akoguz2025interoperability])

-   Parlour et al. (2022) [@parlour2022fintech] claim that data-subjects
    may be better off if a private entity or a social planner negotiated
    collectively on their behalf regarding the terms of access to their
    data.

-   API aggregators can become new intermediaries that leverage network
    effects to gain market dominance and appropriate rent.

-   Open Banking/Finance puts financial institutions at disadvantage
    against the BigTech entry into finance as the latter is not subject
    to Open Banking/Finance regulations.
